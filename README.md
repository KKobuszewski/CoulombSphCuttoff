# CoulombSphCuttoff

Library for Coulomb potential calculation from continuous charge distribution. The code is developed for research purpose by Nuclear Theory Group, Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology.

## Limitations

* Each dimension of computional lattice is assumed to be even.

## Compilation

* change path to library in Makefile
* assuming CUDA is in /usr/local/cuda
* type
```
make coulomb
```
